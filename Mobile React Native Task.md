# Software Engineer (Mobile) - React Native Task
Please attempt the following assessment and share your task repository by completing task submission form here - http://nepal.introcept.co/job-application-task-submission/. 

## Task
Write a simple application in react (or react native) that can take
input from the user.

The user should be able to enter multiple entries of:
- Name:
- Country:
- Favorite Phone Brand:
- Phone Number:

## Task Guidelines
- The user can enter as many records as they like. After they've added the records, they will
be able to see it on a table.
- Create an interface that will also allow to filter the table records by Country and Favorite
Phone Brand.
- You do not need to connect to the database. Store everything locally.
- We'll only be looking at how you structure the codebase more than how the UI looks, but
bonus points on keeping it simple and functional.

## Bonus points
- Adding any form of automated tests like unit or functional will be a plus point.
- Wiring up your tests with a continuous integration (CI) service and reporting coverage is a
huge plus. Wercker.com is a good free CI even for private repos. If you open source your
code and use Travis CI that is also fine.
- Any relevant details in the readme.me file is a plus.
