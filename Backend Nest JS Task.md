# Software Engineer (Full Stack) - Typescript / Nest.JS Task 
Please attempt the following assessment and share your task repository or any attachments through email at career@globalyhub.com. 

The task is to build a part of the client section of a system. It should be done in max 7
days after receiving it if not communicated otherwise.

## Context
This is a simple coding task not a coding challenge. This has only Create and Read of
the small CRUD part for the client section of the application.

## Task
Things to do
1. Create a form to get
    1. Name
    1. Gender
    1. Phone
    1. Email
    1. Address
    1. Nationality
    1. Date of birth
    1. Education background
    1. Preferred mode of contact (select one from email, phone, none)
1. You can be creative with the fields.
1. Add relevant validation to the form both frontend (js) and backend (Nest.js)
1. After form submission, if fields are valid save to a csv file
1. Show all clients pulled in from the CSV as another page

## Things to consider
1. As the task is easy, we will look into the software design part of things, just
making it work is not enough.
2. Naming classes, methods and variables properly will be checked.
3. Simple code is better, still think how easy it will be to add things like update and
delete clients later.
4. The way you construct URLs will also be evaluated.
5. Your git commit history will tell a story of how you thought of the solution please
be mindful of it. If you use Pull request to come to your solution it's even better.
6. Code it so that the next person who continues that work will like it and not hate
the code. Think maintainability of code.
7. Tip: First break your task into logical parts then code it. (First solve the problem.
Then write code. - John Johnson)
8. Tip: Commented code is bad, relevant comments about code will be necessary.

## Rules/Requirements
1. You must use Nest.js framework.
2. You must have a readme.md file in the root, well formatted in markdown (like the
one you are reading now) that explains your solution.
3. Use of any extra open-source library or package is allowed only via npm. You will
need to explain why you used it in the readme file.
4. You can use any front-end library or framework, react preferred.
5. You must use git and submit this task as a private or public git repository on
github/bitbucket another option is a zip/tar file.

## Bonus points
1. If you can add a detail view page to the listing page, it will be good.
2. Adding pagination will earn you some more points.
3. Adding any form of automated tests like unit or functional will be a plus point.
4. Wiring up your tests with a continuous integration (CI) service and reporting
coverage is a huge plus. Wercker.com is a good free CI even for private repos. If
you open source your code and use Travis CI that is also fine.
5. Hosting your small application in a free service provider will earn you additional
points. Think of first level security too. You can host in on Zeit with now-cli,
Heroku, elastx.se/en or any free host. If you use a free host
do mention how you deployed the application.
6. If you can run your repo through a code quality checking service like codeclimate
it would be great.
7. Any relevant details in the readme.me file is a plus.

## Final Note
Just completing the task might be a 2-4 hour job. If you just complete the requirements
of the task it's like getting 40 out of 100. You have been given 7 days so roughly 24
hours (work time) considering that you will invest time in learning things you might not
know like automated testing, CI and logging with libraries like monolog and even deploy
the app. If you surprise us with a dockerfile in your solution we will be happy.

This task can be done by a student, a software engineer with 1 year experience or a
software engineer with 5+ years of experience. The main question is do you aim for
100/100 or just 40/100 that will just pass you in the task, make a wise decision. Don't do
things to just make it work, think about making it maintainable too.
