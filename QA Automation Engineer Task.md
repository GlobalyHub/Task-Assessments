Please access the following sample application - http://computer-database.herokuapp.com/computers 315

Create a series of manual test cases that cover the CRUD operation plus the edge cases. Make sure you give detailed instructions for each test case (pre conditions, steps, expected results). You can use any format you want.

Write scripts that would automate the manual test cases that you see fit to be included in a regression test set. Please use any of below programming languages:

Javascript (preferred)
Java (preferred)
Python
Ruby
(Please avoid frameworks that only record test cases.)
When the assessment is completed, please push the file containing the manual test cases and the automation project to GitHub.
It think it would be a great group learning exercise if others tried the exercise and shared your results so we could discuss the different approaches we all took.

This was my attempt at the above assignment https://github.com/vivrichards600/QATestingCaseKata
